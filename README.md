Project Name: Facial Expression Recognition

This project aims to develop a computer system that can analyze and interpret human facial expressions in order to detect and interpret emotions. It uses computer vision techniques and machine learning to analyze patterns in the face such as the movement of facial muscles, changes in skin color, and other visual cues.
Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

Prerequisites:

To run this project, you will need the following software:

    Visual Studio Code
    Python

You will also need to install the following libraries:

    Numpy
    TensorFlow
    OpenCV
